To communicate with xmms2d, you need an instance of the
xmmsclient.XMMS object, which abstracts the connection.
First you need to initialize the connection; as argument
you need to pass "name" of your client. The name has to
be in the range [a-zA-Z0-9] because xmms is deriving
configuration values from this name.
"""

"""
Now we need to connect to xmms2d. We need to
pass the XMMS ipc-path to the connect call.
If passed None, it will default to 
unix:///tmp/xmms-ipc-<user>, but all xmms2 clients
should handle the XMMS_PATH enviroment in
order to configure connection path.

XMMS.connect will throw IOError if an error occured.

This is all you have to do to connect to xmms2d.
Now we can send commands. Let's do something easy
like getting xmms2d to start playback.

xmmsclient.XMMSResult is the type of object returned
from all commands that are given to the xmms2d server.

The command will be sent, and since this is a
synchronous connection we can block for its 
return here. The async / sync issue will be
commented on later.

When XMMSResult.wait() returns, we have the
answer from the server. Let's check for errors
and print it out if something went wrong
